The application is a MCQ Test which we have developed using Java Swings.
It has multiple frames :  1.)Login. 2.)Instructions. 3.)Test. 4.)Final Score.
It is a timer based application(15 mins.).Timer is setup using Threads.

We have used jdbc and mysql server. The login credentials are checked by matching entries in the server database.
Once time gets over or user clicks "Submit", the score is updated in the database.

From the database, we can then sort by marks and select the top participants.
